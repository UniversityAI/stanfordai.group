# Stanford AI Group (SAIG) Website 
This repo hosts the [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)-based sourcecode for the [Stanford AI Group website (SAIG)](http://stanfordai.group/).

> **Note**: *We currently host the site using Github pages in the `gh-pages` branch of the repo. This is subject to change as we move onto official Stanford hosting in the coming months.*

## Tech Stack

- Built on [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
- Uses [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark) for Markdown processing.

## Making Changes

You can run the development server with `gatsby develop` and see live changes in-browser as you edit the code.

Run `yarn deploy` once you're ready to publish changes, and you should be able to immediately see changes on the actual site.
